1. Map
    General: Maps is an interface that represents a collection of key-value pairs. It cannot contain duplicate keys, and each key maps to at most one value.
    Key Methods: put(K key, V value), get(Object key), remove(Object key), containsKey(Object key), containsValue(Object value), keySet(), values(), entrySet().

2. HashMap
    General: HashMap is a concrete implementation of the Map interface. It uses a hash table to store the map's entries, providing constant-time performance for basic operations (get and put), assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets.
    Ordering: Does not guarantee any specific order of the keys.
    Performance: Generally offers the best performance for most use cases (constant-time complexity for get and put operations).
    Null Values: Allows one null key and multiple null values.
    Usage: Best when insertion order is not important and you need fast access to elements.

3. SortedMap
    Description: SortedMap is an interface that extends Map. It maintains its entries in ascending order of the keys, which can be natural ordering or determined by a specified comparator.
    Key Methods: In addition to Map methods, it includes firstKey(), lastKey(), subMap(K fromKey, K toKey), headMap(K toKey), tailMap(K fromKey).

4. TreeMap
    Description: TreeMap is a concrete implementation of the SortedMap interface. It uses a Red-Black tree structure to store the map entries.
    Ordering: Maintains entries in ascending order of the keys.
    Performance: Operations like get, put, remove take O(log n) time due to the tree structure.
    Null Values: Does not allow null keys but allows null values.
    Usage: Best when a sorted map is required, and you need to access elements in a specific order.


   Summary of Differences
Map: General interface for key-value pairs.
HashMap: Unordered, allows null keys/values, fast performance.
SortedMap: Interface for maps that maintain sorted order.
TreeMap: Implementation of SortedMap, ordered, does not allow null keys, moderate performance.


(A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node stores an extra bit representing "color" ("red" or "black") to ensure the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions. The balancing is not perfect but is good enough to ensure that the tree's height is logarithmic relative to the number of nodes, which guarantees O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations.)
